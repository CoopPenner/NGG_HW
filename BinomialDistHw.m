%HW 3 Binomial Battle


% % Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, 
% % and for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. 
% % For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?

% ok, nice n simple

p=0.2;
n=0:1:10;

%% Binomial distribution
%
%  Python: https://github.com/PennNGG/Quantitative-Neuroscience/blob/master/Probability%20Distributions/Python/Binomial.ipynb
%
% Distribution of the number of successful outcomes for a given number 
%  of Bernoulli trials in a given experiment, defined by two parameters:
%  p = probability of success on each trial (constant across trials)
%  n = number of trials
%
%  This is also a DISCRETE distribution because by definition it only 
%  takes on specific, discrete values (in this case non-negative integers 
%  corresponding to the number of successes in n tries; thus, values 0:n).

% Choose some values for the parameters n and p
p = 0.7;
n = 1000;

% Generate random picks. Note that this is as if we did the Bernoulli
% trials as above, but then just counted the successes
outcome = binornd(n,p);

% Print out the results
fprintf('%d successes out of %d trials, simulated p = %.2f, empirical p = %.2f\n', ...
   n, outcome, p, outcome/n)

% The full probability distribution describes the probabilty of obtaining
%  each possible number of successes (k), given n and p. If we set n=10,
%  the the possible values of k are 0, 1, ..., 10. Now we use binornd
%  to simulate many different picks to get a full distribution
p = 0.2;
n = 10;       % number of "trials" per "experiment"
NumExperiments = 1000;     % number of "experiments"
outcomes = binornd(n,p,NumExperiments,1);

% Make histogram of all possible outcomes. We want bins centered on whole
% numbers so we offset the edges
edges = -0.5:10.5;
counts = histcounts(outcomes, edges);

% Show a bar plot of the simulated bionimal distribution
clf;
xs = edges(1:end-1)+diff(edges)/2;
bar(xs, counts);
title(sprintf('Histogram of binomial distribution, n=%d, p=%.2f, N=%d simulations', ...
   n,p,N));
xlabel(sprintf('Number of successes in %d tries', n));
ylabel('Count');

% Normalize it to make it a pdf. Here counts (the x-axis of the histogram)
%  is a DISCRETE variable, so we just have to add up the values
